# Version Tracking

This document tracks version changes following [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

## Semantic Versioning Summary

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Version History

  - Added mindpalace visualization enhancement roadmap (grouping, filters, export)
  - Marked httpx/nuclei integration as completed
